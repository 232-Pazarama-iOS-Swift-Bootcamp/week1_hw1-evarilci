# Command line Witcher adventure game

I have been tryring to figure how to build an effecive command line app. Then came up with an idea. idea of making witcher game that playable through command prompts. It was fun to write but because this was an assignment for my bootcamp and ran out of time frankly I could not manage to finish it. But that does not mean that it is not functional nor I won't finish it. As I said it is very fun to work on and and I'm gonna finish it ASAP.

## How to play?

- first of all you should download the project(to the desktop preferably) then write the commands below on terminal.

```
cd Desktop/ödev--1/ödev1_Eymen_Varilci/ödev1_Eymen_Varilci
//press return 
swift main.swift
//press return and you are in

```
- you can start the game typing "start" and end the game typing "quit"
- journey begins in a village and narrator tells the story
- you should go to the vendor first typing "vendor"
- Witcher has 100 silver in the beginning. You can buy a sword with it by typing "sword". you can type "arrow" and "armor" to buy those but you don't have enough silver
- type "stats" for see your properties like items, silvers and potions you have.

### It is just that for now but I intend to develope it even further. If you are interested please feel free to let me know.
